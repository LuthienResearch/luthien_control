# Current Working Context

## Implementation Phase
- Phase 2: Control Engine Development
- Currently implementing communications logging infrastructure

## Working State
### Completed
- Basic SQLAlchemy models for communications and relationships
- Simple DBLogger implementation with core functionality:
  - Communication logging
  - Relationship tracking
  - Basic querying

### In Progress
- Database setup and migrations
- Integration with proxy server
- Testing infrastructure

### Not Started
- UI/API for exploring communications
- Advanced querying features
- Async support

## Current Blockers
None

## Next Steps
1. Create database migration scripts
2. Write basic test suite
3. Integrate with proxy server
4. Design and implement exploration UI/API

## Data Model (Current Draft)

- id: uuid
- source: text
- destination: text
- type: enum (request, response)
- timestamp: timestamp
- content: jsonb
- endpoint: text
- arguments: jsonb
- trigger: jsonb

### CommRelationship Table
