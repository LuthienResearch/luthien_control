# Control Framework Use Cases

## Policy Development Through Historical Analysis
### Scenario
Developing a policy to prevent AI assistants from adding secrets to code

### Requirements
- Search historical responses for patterns of secret disclosure
- Analyze context that led to these responses
- Test policy effectiveness using historical data
- Support for local LLM integration for response analysis

### Implementation Details
1. Analysis Infrastructure Needs
   - Full-text search on message content
   - Relationship tracking between requests/responses
   - Query API for complex relationship traversal
   - UI for visualizing request chains

2. Policy Development Tools
   - Historical data analysis capabilities
   - Local LLM integration support
   - Policy testing framework
   - Effectiveness metrics and reporting

## Red Team Testing Infrastructure
### Scenario
Multi-layer proxy setup for security testing

### Requirements
- Support chain of control servers (client -> control -> red team -> backend)
- Track relationship between requests/responses across the chain
- Identify attempts to circumvent policies
- Compare behavior with/without red team interference

### Implementation Details
1. Infrastructure Needs
   - Multi-proxy chain deployment support
   - Red team simulation environment
   - Policy bypass detection
   - Comparative analysis tools

2. Analysis Capabilities
   - Pattern detection across historical data
   - Policy effectiveness monitoring
   - Integration with external analysis tools
