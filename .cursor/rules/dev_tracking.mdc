## MANDATORY: Update tracking files after EVERY change

After EACH of the following (without exception):
- Creating or modifying any file
- Running any command that changes system state
- Completing a deployment step
- Encountering or resolving any error
- Before moving to a new task

You MUST:

### 1. Update dev/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md - Historical Record
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Brief Action Title

### Changes Made
- Specific file changes or commands executed
- Include exact commands with outputs if relevant

### Current Status
- What's currently working
- What's currently broken
- Any errors encountered (with exact error messages)

### Next Steps
- Clear, actionable next steps
```

### 2. Update dev/CURSOR_CONTEXT.md - Current State Snapshot
```markdown
# Current Working Context
[Replace entire file with current state - this is NOT a log]

## Implementation Phase
- Current project phase (reference ProjectPlan.md)
- Specific component being worked on

## Working State
- What is currently working (specific features)
- What is not working/incomplete
- Recent changes made

## Current Blockers
- Active issues preventing progress
- Questions requiring answers
- Missing dependencies or configurations

## Next Steps
1. Next immediate action
2. Subsequent planned actions
3. Outstanding issues to address
```

## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES

1. **Update First**: Always update tracking files BEFORE moving to a new task
2. **Be Specific**: Include specific file names, commands, and error messages
3. **Complete Replacement**: For dev/CURSOR_CONTEXT.md, replace the entire file with current state
4. **Timestamps**: Always include timestamps in dev/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md entries
5. **No Skipping**: These updates are mandatory for ALL changes, no matter how small

IMPORTANT: This is not optional. Every change requires tracking file updates.
