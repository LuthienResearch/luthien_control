## [2024-02-27 11:06] - Project Initialization and Setup

### Changes Made
- Reorganized planning documents: Created `README.md`, `dev/ProjectPlan.md`, `dev/ToDo.md`; deleted `dev/ProjectPlanningOverview.md`.
- Created initial project structure: `luthien_control/` package with `__init__.py`, `tests/` directory.
- Initialized Poetry (`pyproject.toml`) and added core dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, asyncpg) and dev dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, bandit).
- Created new Cursor rules: `config_and_secrets.mdc`, `security_practices.mdc`.
- Updated existing rules (`change_guidelines.mdc`, `dev_tracking.mdc`, `rule_management.mdc`) to reflect refined tracking frequency and glob formatting preference.
- Added `.gitignore` with standard entries and `.env`.
- Created basic FastAPI app in `luthien_control/main.py` with a `/health` endpoint.
- Created and executed log rotation script `dev/scripts/rotate_dev_log.sh`.

### Current Status
- Basic project structure is in place.
- Core dependencies are installed via Poetry.
- Basic FastAPI application is running with a health check.
- Planning documents and rules are updated.

### Next Steps
- Commit initial project setup.
- Implement the core proxy endpoint in `luthien_control/main.py`.
- Define and implement basic client authentication.
