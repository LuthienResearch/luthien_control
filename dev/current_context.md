## Last Task Completed
- **Implement API Key Authentication:** Added mandatory API key authentication (`Authorization: Bearer <key>`) for all proxy endpoints.
    - Stored keys in a new `api_keys` table in the main PostgreSQL database.
    - Implemented database models, connection pool management, CRUD operations, and FastAPI dependency.
    - Added comprehensive unit tests for new components.
    - Updated development log.

## Current State
- The application now requires a valid, active API key passed via the `Authorization: Bearer` header to access the proxy endpoints (`/` and `/beta`).
- Database schema for API keys is defined and initialized.
- Unit tests cover the authentication logic.
- Development log is up-to-date.

## Next Steps / Focus
- Consider adding integration/E2E tests that specifically verify the authentication requirement on the endpoints.
- Address Pydantic v2 deprecation warnings.
- Continue implementing features from the project plan or address items from `dev/ToDo.md`.
