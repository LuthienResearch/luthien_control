# Current Working Context

## Implementation Phase
- Project Phase: Core Feature Development & Upkeep (Ref: ProjectPlan.md)
- Specific Component: Preparing for Policy Engine Implementation

## Working State
- What is currently working:
  - Proxy server core functionality (`luthien_control/proxy/server.py`) with 100% unit test coverage.
  - Integration tests for proxy server (`tests/integration/test_proxy_server.py`) are passing (locally).
  - Basic logging infrastructure (file, API, DB) skeleton exists.
  - Basic policy management framework skeleton exists.
  - Poetry environment and basic project structure are set up.
  - Deployment via Fly.io is functional.
- What is not working/incomplete:
  - Policy Engine (`policies/`) is not implemented beyond the basic framework.
  - Logging (`logging/`) functionality needs implementation and testing.
  - Authentication/Authorization is not implemented.
  - Unit test coverage for modules other than `proxy/server.py` is low.
  - Overall project test coverage needs improvement (last checked ~62%).
- Recent changes made:
  - Achieved 100% unit test coverage for `proxy/server.py`.
  - Debugged test execution issues.
  - Cleaned up unused files (`test_decode.py`, `CLAUDE.md`).
  - Updated `dev/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`.

## Current Blockers
- None currently.

## Next Steps
1. **Configure and run static analysis tools** (e.g., linters like `ruff`, `mypy`; security scanner like `bandit`).
2. **Begin implementation and testing of the Policy Engine** (`policies/`). Define policy structure, implement evaluation logic.
3. Implement and test the **Logging module** (`logging/`) ensuring proper data handling.
4. Incrementally improve **test coverage** across the project.

## Data Model (Current Draft)
### Comm Table
- id: uuid
- source: text
- destination: text
- type: enum (request, response)
- timestamp: timestamp
- content: jsonb
- endpoint: text
- arguments: jsonb
- trigger: jsonb

### CommRelationship Table
- id: uuid
- from_comm_id: uuid
- to_comm_id: uuid
- relationship_type: text
- meta_info: jsonb  # Note: Renamed from metadata to avoid SQLAlchemy conflict
