.  **No Redundant Comments:** Only comment non-trivial logic. Avoid comments that merely state the obvious (e.g., `# Import module`, `# Loop through items`). Adhere strictly to the global `<comments>` instruction provided during generation.
2.  **No Change Explanations in Code:** NEVER add comments to explain *why* a code change was made (e.g., `# Removed X`, `# Moved Y to Z`, `# Refactored this section`). Explain changes in the chat discussion only. This reinforces `change_guidelines` point 5.
3.  **Delete, Don't Comment Out:** NEVER leave commented-out blocks of code in the source files. Delete unused or obsolete code directly. Use version control (Git) to track history.
3.1. **Verification of Deletion Edits:** When an `edit_file` operation is intended to delete lines or blocks of code:
        a.  The `instructions` field for the `edit_file` tool should explicitly state the intent to delete (e.g., "Delete lines X-Y," "Remove the following function...").
        b.  The `code_edit` content should show the complete absence of the code, not commented-out versions.
        c.  If, after an edit, there's any indication (e.g., from a diff, a subsequent tool error, or user feedback) that the code was commented out instead of deleted, a corrective `edit_file` operation MUST be immediately proposed and executed to ensure complete removal. This is a high-priority correction.
