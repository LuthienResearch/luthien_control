## 2024-03-27 14:45:00 - Production Deployment to Fly.io

### Changes Made
- Created Dockerfile for containerization
- Created fly.toml configuration
- Modified run.py to conditionally use SSL certificates
- Added health check endpoint to server.py
- Fixed content-encoding header handling in server.py
- Updated README.md with deployment instructions
- Updated tracking file location to dev/ directory

### Commands Run
```bash
brew install flyctl
fly auth login
fly launch
fly deploy
fly secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY="<redacted>"
```

### Current Status
- Application successfully deployed to Fly.io
- Health check endpoint working
- SSL termination handled by Fly.io edge servers
- API proxy functionality verified
- Fixed issues with header handling for responses

### Next Steps
1. Set up custom domain if needed
2. Monitor performance in production
3. Add additional features as planned in project roadmap
4. Consider scaling options for production use

## [2023-07-28 14:30] - Implemented Control Policy Framework

### Changes Made
- Created new policies module with base.py containing ControlPolicy abstract base class
- Created policy manager in policies/manager.py to register and apply policies
- Updated server.py to integrate policy manager into request/response flow
- Added NoopPolicy in policies/examples/noop_policy.py as default policy
- Created TokenCounterPolicy as an example (commented out in initialization)
- Created initialization module in proxy/initialize.py
- Updated policies/__init__.py with new imports

### Current Status
- Control policy framework is fully implemented
- The system now supports pluggable policies for request/response processing
- NoopPolicy is registered as default policy, preserving original behavior
- The proxy server now processes requests and responses through policy manager

### Next Steps
- Implement specific control policies as needed
- Add tests for the policy framework
- Consider adding configuration options for enabling/disabling policies

## [2024-03-19 Current Time] - Planning Request/Response Exploration System

### Changes Made
- Developed initial data model for tracking proxy communications
- Established terminology: using "Comm" as base unit
- Designed preliminary schema for Comm and CommRelationship tables

### Current Status
- Working: N/A (Planning Phase)
- Design Decisions Made:
  - Using PostgreSQL for storage
  - Two-table design (Comm + CommRelationship)
  - Flexible relationship modeling with string types
  - JSON fields for content and metadata
  - No constraints on relationships initially

### Next Steps
- Research standard HTTP/networking terms for source/destination
- Design basic indexes
- Plan query patterns
- Design API for logging/querying
- Plan minimal UI requirements

## [2024-03-25 12:30] - Implemented Communications Logging System

### Changes Made
- Added SQLAlchemy and asyncpg dependencies via poetry
- Created database models for communications and relationships
- Implemented simplified DBLogger for tracking communications

### Current Status
- Basic communication logging is implemented with:
  - Source/destination tracking
  - Request/response type tracking
  - Content storage as JSONB
  - Flexible relationship tracking between communications
  - Simple query interface for related communications

### Implementation Details
```python
# Core data model:
Comm:
  - id: UUID
  - source: Text
  - destination: Text
  - type: Enum("REQUEST", "RESPONSE")
  - content: JSONB
  - endpoint: Text
  - arguments: JSONB
  - trigger: JSONB  # For control-server originated comms

CommRelationship:
  - id: UUID
  - from_comm_id: UUID
  - to_comm_id: UUID
  - relationship_type: Text
  - metadata: JSONB
```

### Usage Example
```python
logger = DBLogger(session)

# Log a request
request_comm = logger.log_comm(
    source="client",
    destination="proxy",
    comm_type="REQUEST",
    content={"body": request.json()},
    endpoint=request.url,
    arguments=request.query_params
)

# Log and link a related communication
response_comm = logger.log_comm(
    source="proxy",
    destination="client",
    comm_type="RESPONSE",
    content={"body": response.json()}
)

# Create relationship
logger.add_relationship(
    request_comm,
    response_comm,
    "request_response"
)
```

### Next Steps
1. Create database migration scripts
2. Add basic test suite
3. Implement proxy integration
4. Consider adding:
   - Query methods for common use cases
   - Async support if needed
   - UI/API for exploring logged communications

## [2024-03-25 12:38] - Implemented Test Suite for Communications Logging

### Changes Made
- Added pytest and related dependencies (pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov)
- Created comprehensive test suite for models and database logger
- Fixed SQLAlchemy naming conflict (renamed metadata to meta_info)
- Added test configuration in pyproject.toml

### Current Status
- Test coverage for core components:
  - Database models (Comm, CommRelationship)
  - Database logger (DBLogger)
  - Relationship tracking and navigation
- Tests verify:
  - Basic CRUD operations
  - Relationship creation and querying
  - Complex relationship chains
  - Data integrity

### Next Steps
1. Add integration tests with proxy server
2. Add performance tests for database operations
3. Fix api_logger tests
4. Add more edge case tests
