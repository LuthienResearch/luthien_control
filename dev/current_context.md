# Current Working Context
[Replace entire file with current state - this is NOT a log]

## Implementation Phase
- Initial Project Setup (Complete & Committed)
- Next: Foundational Proxy & Logging (Phase 2 from ProjectPlan.md)
- Specific component: Core proxy endpoint implementation in `luthien_control/main.py`.

## Working State
- Initial project setup committed (f8f9be8).
- Basic FastAPI application runs (`poetry run uvicorn luthien_control.main:app --reload`) with `/health` endpoint.
- Linters and security checks pass (`ruff`, `bandit`).
- Pre-commit hooks are active.
- `poetry run pytest` runs (finds no tests).

## Current Blockers
- None. Ready for next implementation step.

## Next Steps
1. Implement the core proxy endpoint in `luthien_control/main.py` to accept OpenAI-compatible requests.
2. Define and implement a basic client authentication mechanism (e.g., static API key header).
3. Add initial unit tests for the proxy endpoint and authentication.
