# Current Task
## Implement Parallel Beta Proxy Endpoint

**Goal:** Create a new API endpoint `/beta/{full_path:path}` that handles proxy requests using the `run_policy_flow` orchestrator, running in parallel with the existing `/ {full_path:path}` endpoint.

**Status:** Completed (with debugging).

**Changes Made:**
- Implemented `proxy_endpoint_beta` in `luthien_control/proxy/server.py` using `run_policy_flow`.
- Added dependency providers (`get_initial_context_policy`, `get_control_policies`, `get_response_builder`) in `server.py`.
- Implemented unit tests for `proxy_endpoint_beta` in `tests/proxy/test_server.py`, mocking `run_policy_flow`.
- Debugged and fixed issues related to imports, route order, dependency injection in policy providers, test assertions, and missing `@runtime_checkable` decorators on protocols.
- Ran all tests (`poetry run pytest`) - all passed (74 passed, 1 deselected).

**Follow-up tasks:**
- Proceed with Git commit as per `git_commit_strategy`.
- Consider future tasks:
    - Dynamic loading/configuration of `ControlPolicy` sequence.
    - Strategy for migrating traffic/tests from original endpoint to `/beta`.
