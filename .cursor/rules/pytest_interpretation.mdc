# Interpreting Pytest Results

1.  **Check the Summary Line:** Do not rely solely on the command's exit code (e.g., "Exit code: 0"). Always look for the `pytest` summary line at the end of the output (e.g., `==== X passed, Y failed, Z warnings in S.ss ====`).
2.  **Zero Failures Required:** A successful test run means the summary line explicitly shows **0 failed**. Any number of failures indicates a problem that must be addressed.
3.  **Analyze Failures:** If failures are reported, carefully examine the detailed failure output provided by `pytest` to understand the cause. Do not proceed until all tests pass.
