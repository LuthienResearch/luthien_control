# Current Working Context
[Updated March 29, 2024 17:59]

## Implementation Phase
- Rule Management
- Specific component: Creation of `git_commit_strategy.mdc` rule.

## Working State
- New rule `.cursor/rules/git_commit_strategy.mdc` created.
- This rule defines a streamlined process for Git commits, including mandatory pre-commit updates to tracking files (`dev/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, `dev/CURSOR_CONTEXT.md`).
- The `dev/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` file was rotated due to length, and the new log file contains the entry for creating the commit rule.

## Current Blockers
- None.

## Next Steps
1. **Commit:** Stage and commit the new rule file (`.cursor/rules/git_commit_strategy.mdc`) and the updated tracking files (`dev/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, `dev/CURSOR_CONTEXT.md`).
