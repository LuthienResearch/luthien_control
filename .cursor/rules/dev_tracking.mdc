Mandatory dev tracking updates prior to git commits

### 1. Rotate Log (If Necessary)

**Before adding a new log entry**, ALWAYS run the log rotation script. This script handles checking if rotation is needed based on line count and performs the rotation automatically:
```bash
bash dev/scripts/rotate_dev_log.sh
```
This ensures the active log file remains manageable and archives older entries.

### 2. Update dev/development_log.md - Historical Record
Append the new entry (starting with a newline if the file is not empty or was just created by the rotation script) to the current `dev/development_log.md` using the following format:
```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - [AI Chosen Title]

### Changes Made
- Specific file changes or commands executed
- Include exact commands with outputs if relevant

### Current Status
- What's currently working
- What's currently broken
- Any errors encountered (with exact error messages)
```

### 3. Update dev/current_context.md - Current State Snapshot
Replace the **entire** content of `dev/current_context.md` with the current state using this template:
```markdown
# Current Task
## Short Description of Current Task
 - Status: Complete (or something else if not complete)
 - Major changes made
 - Follow-up tasks, if any (Excluding git commit/push/etc)
```

### 4. Update ProjectPlan.md (if relevant)
Update when items from ProjectPlan.md are completed or the plan significantly changes.

## IMPORTANT GUIDELINES

1.  **Update First**: Always update tracking files BEFORE moving to a new task or ending work.
2.  **Rotate Log First**: Always run the rotation script `bash dev/scripts/rotate_dev_log.sh` *before* appending to `dev/development_log.md`.
3.  **Continuation Header**: The rotation script should handle creating the continuation header in the new log file.
4.  **Be Specific**: Include specific file names, commands, and error messages in the log.
5.  **Complete Replacement**: For `dev/current_context.md`, always replace the entire file content.
6.  **Timestamps**: Use accurate timestamps in `dev/development_log.md` entries.

IMPORTANT: This is not optional. Every change requires running the rotation script and subsequent tracking file updates.
