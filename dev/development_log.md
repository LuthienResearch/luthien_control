## 2025-04-24 17:56: Add Swagger UI API Key Support & Test No-Auth Passthrough

**Status:** Completed

**Changes:**
- **Swagger UI Auth:** Modified `luthien_control/proxy/server.py` to use `HTTPBearer` security scheme for the `/api/{full_path:path}` endpoint, enabling the "Authorize" button in Swagger UI for Bearer tokens. Added a docstring clarification that the token is only required if the active policy enforces authentication.
- **Test:** Added `test_api_proxy_no_auth_policy_no_key_success` to `tests/proxy/test_server.py`. This integration-style test verifies that requests without an `Authorization` header succeed when the main control policy does not perform authentication checks.
    - Uses dependency overrides (`get_main_control_policy`) to inject a `CompoundPolicy` containing a local `PassThroughPolicy` and a `MockSendBackendRequestPolicy`.
    - The `MockSendBackendRequestPolicy` sets a predefined successful `httpx.Response` in `context.response`.
    - Asserts the final response status code is 200 and the JSON body matches the expected backend data.
- **Refactor:** Modified `luthien_control/proxy/orchestration.py` (`run_policy_flow`) to *always* call the `ResponseBuilder` after successful policy execution, removing the logic that bypassed the builder if `context.response` was pre-set by a policy. Ensured `DefaultResponseBuilder` correctly handles pre-set `context.response`. This provides a more consistent response generation flow.

**Next Steps:**
- Commit changes.
- Define and begin next development task.

## 2025-04-24 18:00: Fix Test Failure After Editor Glitch

**Status:** Completed

**Changes:**
- **Test Fix:** Restored the correct test structure in `tests/proxy/test_server.py` for `test_api_proxy_no_auth_policy_no_key_success`. This involved re-adding the `MockSendBackendRequestPolicy`, ensuring the `CompoundPolicy` containing `[PassThroughPolicy(), MockSendBackendRequestPolicy()]` was injected via dependency override, and removing incorrect http client mocking/assertions. This corrected a test failure (`assert 500 == 200`) apparently caused by an editor glitch reverting previous changes.
- **Verification:** Confirmed that the logic in `luthien_control/proxy/orchestration.py` correctly calls the `ResponseBuilder` even when `context.response` is pre-set, which is necessary for the test structure to work without modifying application code just for the test.

**Next Steps:**
- Commit changes.
- Define and begin next development task.
