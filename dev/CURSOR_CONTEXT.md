# Current Working Context

## Implementation Phase
- Phase 2: Control Engine Development
- Currently implementing communications logging infrastructure
- Focus on testing and quality assurance

## Working State
### Completed
- Basic SQLAlchemy models for communications and relationships
- Simple DBLogger implementation with core functionality
- Comprehensive test suite for core components
  - Model tests
  - Logger tests
  - Relationship tracking tests

### In Progress
- Integration tests with proxy server
- Performance testing
- Edge case testing

### Not Started
- UI/API for exploring communications
- Advanced querying features
- Async support

## Current Blockers
- Need to fix api_logger tests

## Next Steps
1. Add integration tests with proxy server
2. Add performance tests for database operations
3. Fix api_logger tests
4. Add more edge case tests

## Data Model (Current Draft)
### Comm Table
- id: uuid
- source: text
- destination: text
- type: enum (request, response)
- timestamp: timestamp
- content: jsonb
- endpoint: text
- arguments: jsonb
- trigger: jsonb

### CommRelationship Table
- id: uuid
- from_comm_id: uuid
- to_comm_id: uuid
- relationship_type: text
- meta_info: jsonb  # Note: Renamed from metadata to avoid SQLAlchemy conflict
