# Current Task
## Complete: Verify DB Test Setup & Resolve Settings Validation Issues

- Status: Complete
- Major changes made:
    - Fixed initial DB integration test (`test_db_connection_and_schema`).
    - Made `POSTGRES_*` settings optional in `Settings` model (`config/settings.py`) to allow proxy unit tests to pass validation.
    - Added runtime checks to DSN helper methods in `Settings` model to ensure DB settings are present when needed.
    - Verified all unit and integration tests pass.
- Follow-up tasks, if any:
    - Commit changes.
    - Address ToDo item regarding config management strategy (`dev/ToDo.md`).
