# Streaming Response Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to make the Luthien Control framework compatible with streaming responses. Currently, the framework processes requests through a policy chain and returns complete responses. We need to extend it to handle streaming responses where multiple response chunks are sent for a single request.

**Status: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** ✅

The core streaming response functionality has been successfully implemented and is ready for production use. All phases of the implementation plan have been completed except for optional E2E testing with real endpoints.

## Current Architecture

### Request Flow
1. **Entry Point**: `proxy/orchestration.py:run_policy_flow()`
   - Initializes transaction based on request type (OpenAI or raw)
   - Applies main policy chain
   - Builds final response from transaction

2. **Policy Application**: `ControlPolicy.apply()`
   - Each policy transforms the transaction
   - Policies can generate responses
   - Other policies may act on generated responses

3. **Backend Communication**: `SendBackendRequestPolicy`
   - Handles actual API calls
   - Currently detects streaming but stores in `transaction.data`
   - No proper streaming response handling

4. **Response Building**
   - Expects complete responses in `transaction.openai_response.payload`
   - Converts to FastAPI responses

### Previous Limitations (Now Resolved)
- ~~No streaming iterator support in Transaction model~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Added `StreamingResponseIterator` types and Transaction.is_streaming property
- ~~Orchestration expects complete responses~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Updated orchestration to detect and route streaming responses
- ~~Policies can't handle streaming data~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Created `StreamingControlPolicy` base class for stream-aware policies
- ~~No streaming response builders~~ ✅ **RESOLVED**: Implemented OpenAI SSE streaming response builders

## Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions
- **Backward Compatibility**: All changes must maintain compatibility with existing non-streaming flows
- **Policy Transparency**: Most policies should work unchanged with streaming responses
- **Error Recovery**: Streaming errors should be handled gracefully without breaking the stream

### Key Challenges (Resolved)
1. **Policy Buffering**: Some policies may need complete responses (e.g., for validation) ✅ **RESOLVED**: `StreamingBuffer` class provides peek/replay functionality
2. **Error Propagation**: How to handle errors mid-stream ✅ **RESOLVED**: Basic SSE error formatting implemented  
3. **Testing**: Mocking streaming responses effectively ✅ **RESOLVED**: Created `ChunkedTextIterator` and comprehensive test suites
4. **Performance**: Ensuring minimal overhead for streaming ✅ **RESOLVED**: Efficient iterator-based design with minimal memory overhead

### Open Questions (Resolved)
- [x] **Should policies be able to modify streaming chunks?** ✅ **RESOLVED**: Yes, via `StreamingControlPolicy.process_chunk()` method
- [ ] **How to handle timeouts in streaming contexts?** ⏳ **DEFERRED**: Can be addressed in future iterations if needed
- [x] **Should we support different streaming formats (SSE, JSONL, etc.)?** ✅ **RESOLVED**: SSE format implemented, extensible design allows for additional formats

### Usage Examples

#### Creating a Stream-Aware Policy
```python
class MyStreamingPolicy(StreamingControlPolicy):
    async def apply_streaming(self, transaction, container, session):
        # Handle streaming transactions
        return transaction
    
    async def apply_non_streaming(self, transaction, container, session):
        # Handle regular transactions
        return transaction
    
    async def process_chunk(self, chunk, transaction, container, session):
        # Optional: process individual chunks
        return f"[PROCESSED] {chunk}"
```

#### Checking for Streaming Responses
```python
if transaction.is_streaming:
    # Handle streaming response
    async for chunk in transaction.openai_response.streaming_iterator:
        process_chunk(chunk)
else:
    # Handle regular response
    result = transaction.openai_response.payload
```
