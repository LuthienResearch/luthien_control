# Current Task
## Integrate Ruff for Formatting and Linting
 - Status: Complete
 - Major changes made:
   - Configured `ruff` in `pyproject.toml` (formatting, linting - E, F, W, I).
   - Ran initial `ruff format` and `ruff check --fix`.
   - Created `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with `ruff` hooks.
   - Fixed syntax error in `dev/scripts/rotate_dev_log.sh`.
 - Follow-up tasks, if any:
   - User action: Run `pre-commit install` to activate hooks locally.
   - Consider enabling more `ruff` lint rules in `pyproject.toml` as needed.
