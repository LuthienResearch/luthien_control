Always maintain development tracking files.

Refer to dev/ProjectGoal.md and dev/ProjectPlan.md for project goal and overall plan, respectively.

After each significant change or command:
<post_change_steps>
1. Update DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md with:
<dev_log_update_components>
 - Current status
 - Where we are in the plan (see dev/ProjectPlan.md)
 - Commands run
 - Any errors encountered
 - Next steps planned
 </dev_log_update_components>

2. Update CURSOR_CONTEXT.md with:
<context_components>
 - Which section of the guide we're implementing
 - What's working
 - What's broken
 - Current blockers
 - Database/model state
 </context_components>
Overwriting existing CURSOR_CONTEXT.md content is allowed and encouraged; this file should be a succinct description of the current working context state, not a historical log of previous context.

When starting a new session:
<new_session_steps>
1. Read CURSOR_CONTEXT.md first
2. Acknowledge the current state
3. Reference relevant sections from the guide
4. Continue from last documented point
</new_session_steps>

Format for updates:
<update_formatting_guidelines>
 -  Use timestamps for each entry
 -  Include all commands run
 -  Document both successes and failures
 -  List any pending tasks
 -  Reference line numbers from guide when relevant
</update_formatting_guidelines>
