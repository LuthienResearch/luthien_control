<project_organization>
0. ALWAYS REFER TO README.md
1. All Python code should be in the luthien_control package
2. Follow the existing directory structure within the package:
   - proxy/ - Proxy server implementation
   - control_policy/ - Implementations of Control Policies
   - utils/ - Utility functions
3. New features should be added as separate modules
4. Tests should be placed in a top-level `tests/` directory, mirroring the structure of the `luthien_control` package (e.g., `tests/proxy/test_server.py` would test `luthien_control/proxy/server.py`).
