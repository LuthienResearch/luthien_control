# Assuming Base is already defined and imported, e.g. from .database import Base or similar
# If not, add: from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
#              Base = declarative_base()


# LuthienLog class was here, now removed as it's in sqlmodel_models.py

# ... any other SQLAlchemy models in this file would remain ...
