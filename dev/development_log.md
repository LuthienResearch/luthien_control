# Development Log - Sun Mar 30 11:05:49 BST 2025

## [2024-02-27 11:06] - Project Initialization and Setup

### Changes Made
- Reorganized planning documents: Created `README.md`, `dev/ProjectPlan.md`, `dev/ToDo.md`; deleted `dev/ProjectPlanningOverview.md`.
- Created initial project structure: `luthien_control/` package with `__init__.py`, `tests/` directory.
- Initialized Poetry (`pyproject.toml`) and added core dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, asyncpg) and dev dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, bandit).
- Created new Cursor rules: `config_and_secrets.mdc`, `security_practices.mdc`.
- Updated existing rules (`change_guidelines.mdc`, `dev_tracking.mdc`, `rule_management.mdc`) to reflect refined tracking frequency and glob formatting preference.
- Added `.gitignore` with standard entries and `.env`.
- Created basic FastAPI app in `luthien_control/main.py` with a `/health` endpoint.
- Created and executed log rotation script `dev/scripts/rotate_dev_log.sh`.

### Current Status
- Basic project structure is in place.
- Core dependencies are installed via Poetry.
- Basic FastAPI application is running with a health check.
- Planning documents and rules are updated.

### Next Steps
- Commit initial project setup.
- Implement the core proxy endpoint in `luthien_control/main.py`.
- Define and implement basic client authentication.

## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Initial Commit and Workflow Correction

### Changes Made
- Ran `git add .` to stage initial project files (after removing dummy file and accounting for pre-commit hook changes).
- Ran `git commit -m "chore: Initial project setup"` (Commit hash: f8f9be8).
- Discussed and clarified the development tracking workflow: `dev/current_context.md` should reflect the state *after* a task (including commits) and list the *next* development task, not the commit itself.

### Current Status
- Initial project setup is committed to the `revampsunday` branch.
- Repository is clean, pre-commit hooks passed.
- Ready to start implementing the core proxy functionality.

### Next Steps
- Update `dev/current_context.md` to reflect the next development tasks (proxy endpoint, auth).
- Begin implementation of the core proxy endpoint.

## [2024-03-31 11:24] - Implement Core Proxy Forwarding Logic

### Changes Made
- Added dependencies `httpx` and `pydantic-settings` using `poetry add httpx pydantic-settings`.
- Created `luthien_control/config/` directory and `luthien_control/config/settings.py` for Pydantic settings.
- Defined `Settings` class in `settings.py` to load `BACKEND_URL` from environment/.env file.
- Modified `luthien_control/proxy/server.py`:
  - Imported `httpx`, `StreamingResponse`, `BackgroundTask`, and `settings`.
  - Initialized an `httpx.AsyncClient`.
  - Added `_close_http_client` function and registered it with FastAPI's shutdown event.
  - Updated `proxy_endpoint` to:
    - Construct backend URL using `settings.BACKEND_URL` and incoming request path/query.
    - Build backend request using `httpx.build_request`, preserving method, headers, and body.
    - Send request to backend via `httpx.send` with streaming enabled.
    - Added basic error handling for `httpx.RequestError` (returns 502).
    - Return a `StreamingResponse` to stream the backend response to the client.
- Created `.env.example` file with `BACKEND_URL`.
- Confirmed `.env` is in `.gitignore`.
- Ran `bash dev/scripts/rotate_dev_log.sh`.

### Current Status
- Basic proxy server structure is in place (`luthien_control/main.py` mounts `luthien_control/proxy/server.py`).
- Configuration management for `BACKEND_URL` is set up via `pydantic-settings` in `luthien_control/config/settings.py`.
- The core proxy endpoint (`/`) now forwards requests (method, headers, query, body) to the configured `BACKEND_URL`.
- Response streaming from the backend to the client is implemented.
- Basic connection error handling (returning 502) is added.
- Requires a `.env` file with `BACKEND_URL` defined to run correctly.

### Next Steps
- Implement policy engine integration.
- Add request/response logging.
- Develop unit and integration tests for the proxy logic.
- Consider more robust error handling and configuration options.

## [2024-07-28 11:46] - Refine Development Workflow Rule

### Changes Made
- Modified `.cursor/rules/development_workflow.mdc` to:
    - Add a new section "Starting a New Task (Pre-Cycle Steps)" detailing validation (`git status`, `current_context.md`) and context setting before core development.
    - Add an "Important Note" emphasizing that rule files are the required mechanism for persistent guidelines and verbal agreements may not persist across sessions.

### Current Status
- `.cursor/rules/development_workflow.mdc` updated with the refined process.
- Ready to commit changes.

### Next Steps
- Commit the changes to `.cursor/rules/development_workflow.mdc`.
- Proceed with the next development task.

## [2024-07-28 11:58] - Refactor Development Tracking Rules

### Changes Made
- Modified `.cursor/rules/dev_tracking.mdc`: Removed trigger list, clarified it defines the *procedure* invoked by other rules.
- Modified `.cursor/rules/development_workflow.mdc`: Updated Step 9 to explicitly mandate running the full tracking procedure (log rotation, log update, context update) after testing and before committing.
- Modified `.cursor/rules/git_commit_strategy.mdc`: Refined Step 4 to clarify that tracking updates occur after work/testing and before staging, referencing `development_workflow.mdc`.

### Current Status
- Rule files updated to integrate tracking updates with the core development/commit workflow.
- Changes ready to be committed.

### Next Steps
- Commit the rule changes.
- Proceed with next development task.

## [2024-07-28 12:24] - Implement Unit Tests for proxy/server.py

### Changes Made
- Created `tests/proxy/` directory structure.
- Added `respx` development dependency via `poetry add --group dev respx`.
- Refactored `pyproject.toml` to use standard `[tool.poetry]` format and added `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` for path discovery.
- Updated author info in `pyproject.toml` to 'Jai Dhyani <jai@luthienresearch.org>'.
- Ran `poetry lock && poetry install` to update environment.
- Created `.env.test` for test-specific configuration (`BACKEND_URL`).
- Modified `luthien_control/config/settings.py` to load `.env.test`.
- Created `tests/proxy/test_server.py` with 5 unit tests using `pytest` and `respx`.
- Refactored `luthien_control/proxy/server.py` to use FastAPI lifespan manager for `httpx.AsyncClient` lifecycle, resolving test client state issues.
- Fixed minor assertion errors in tests (JSON comparison, header check).
- Ran `poetry run pytest`: All 5 tests passed.

### Current Status
- Unit tests for `luthien_control/proxy/server.py` are implemented and passing.
- Core proxy functionality is covered by tests.

### Next Steps
- Review tests for any missing edge cases or scenarios.
- Consider adding integration tests involving the proxy.
- Await next development task.

## [2024-07-28 13:10] - Implement Integration Tests for Proxy

### Changes Made
- Updated `pyproject.toml` to define `integration` and `unit` pytest markers and exclude `integration` by default.
- Created `tests/integration/` directory.
- Updated `luthien_control/config/settings.py`:
    - Added optional `OPENAI_API_KEY` field.
    - Removed global settings instance creation.
    - Added `get_settings()` factory function with `lru_cache` to load `.env` or `.env.test` based on `APP_ENV`.
    - Removed `env_file` tuple from `model_config`.
- Updated `.env.example` and `.env.test` with necessary variables (`BACKEND_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` placeholder). Corrected mock URL in `.env.test` to `http://mock-backend.test:8001`.
- Updated `luthien_control/proxy/server.py`:
    - Changed `proxy_endpoint` to use FastAPI dependency injection (`Depends(get_settings)`) instead of global settings.
    - Refined header forwarding to explicitly set `Host` header based on `BACKEND_URL` and preserve case of other headers.
- Created `tests/conftest.py`:
    - Defined `unit_settings` and `integration_settings` fixtures to load appropriate configurations.
    - Defined `app` fixture to provide FastAPI app instance.
    - Defined `override_settings_dependency` fixture (with `autouse=True`) to inject correct settings based on test markers.
    - Fixed assertion in `unit_settings` to match mock host `mock-backend.test`.
- Updated unit tests (`tests/proxy/test_server.py`):
    - Marked module with `pytestmark = pytest.mark.unit`.
    - Updated tests to use `unit_settings` fixture.
    - Updated `client` fixture to depend on `app` fixture (removed explicit override dependency due to `autouse=True`).
- Created integration tests (`tests/integration/test_proxy_integration.py`):
    - Added `test_proxy_openai_chat_completions` to test successful proxying to live backend using valid key.
    - Added `test_proxy_openai_bad_api_key` to test 401 error propagation with invalid key.
    - Updated tests to run directly against the ASGI `app` using `httpx.ASGITransport` and FastAPI lifespan context manager, removing need for separate server process.

### Current Status
- Unit tests (5) pass (`poetry run pytest`).
- Integration tests (2) pass (`poetry run pytest -m integration`), verifying proxy against live OpenAI API and handling of bad API keys.
- Proxy server correctly forwards requests with necessary header modifications (Host).
- Test setup correctly isolates unit and integration test configurations and execution.

## [2024-07-28 15:21] - Verify DB Test Setup & Resolve Settings Validation Issues

### Changes Made
- Ran initial DB integration test (`tests/integration/test_db_basic.py::test_db_connection_and_schema`).
- Fixed `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute '__anext__'` in `test_db_connection_and_schema` by using the yielded DSN string directly instead of treating the fixture argument as a generator.
- Ran all tests (`poetry run pytest -vs`) and encountered `pydantic_core.ValidationError` during setup for tests in `tests/proxy/test_server.py`.
  - Cause: Recently added mandatory `POSTGRES_*` fields in `luthien_control/config/settings.py` were not present in the `.env.test` file used by proxy unit tests.
- Modified `luthien_control/config/settings.py`:
  - Made `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_DB` optional (`| None = Field(default=None)`).
  - Added runtime `ValueError` checks within the DSN helper properties/methods (`admin_dsn`, `base_dsn`, `get_db_dsn`) to ensure settings are present when those methods are called.
- Verified all unit tests pass (`poetry run pytest -vs`).
- Verified all integration tests pass (`poetry run pytest -vs -m integration`).

### Current Status
- Basic database integration testing fixture (`test_db_session`) is confirmed working.
- Settings validation issue affecting proxy unit tests is resolved by making DB settings optional in the Pydantic model while retaining runtime checks for DB operations.
- All unit and integration tests are passing.
- Ready to commit changes.
