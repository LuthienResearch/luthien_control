# Current Working Context

## Implementation Phase
Currently implementing Phase 1: Transparent Proxy from ProjectPlan.md

## Working State
- Basic project structure is set up
- Initial proxy server implementation is complete
- Basic request forwarding is working
- Logging and authentication need to be implemented

## Current Focus
- Implementing proper request/response logging
- Planning authentication mechanism
- Preparing for test environment setup

## Database/Model State
No database or model state yet - proxy server only handles request forwarding

## Blockers
None currently - basic infrastructure is in place

## Next Steps
1. Implement structured logging for requests/responses
2. Design and implement authentication system
3. Set up test environment
4. Begin API documentation
