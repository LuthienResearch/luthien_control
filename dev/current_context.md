# Current Task
## Implement End-to-End (E2E) Tests for Proxy Server

- Status: Complete
- Major changes made:
    - Replaced old integration tests with new E2E tests in `tests/e2e/`.
    - Implemented local server fixture and `--e2e-target-url` option.
    - Refactored unit test setup in root `conftest.py` and `tests/proxy/test_server.py` to use environment variables (`envvars` marker) for configuration, simplifying logic and improving isolation.
    - Moved mock policies to `luthien_control/testing/mocks/policies.py`.
    - Fixed application code (`proxy/server.py`) to use standard dependency injection for Settings.
    - All unit and E2E tests are passing.
- Follow-up tasks, if any: None.
