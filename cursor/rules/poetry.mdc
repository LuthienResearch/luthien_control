# Poetry Package Management

Always use Poetry for dependency and environment management:

1. Installing/adding packages:
```bash
poetry install            # install all dependencies
poetry add package-name   # add new package
poetry add -D package-name  # add dev dependency
```

2. Running code:
```bash
poetry run python script.py
poetry shell  # activate environment
```

3. Never use pip directly - always use Poetry to manage dependencies.
