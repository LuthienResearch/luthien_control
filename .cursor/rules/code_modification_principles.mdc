# Code Modification Principles

**MANDATORY. FOLLOW THESE RULES.**

1. **Use standard solutions** before custom code.
2. **Create abstractions only when:** code repeats 2+ times, complex logic requires it, or user requests it.
3. **Solve the current problem only.** NO future features.
4. **FIX BUGS DIRECTLY. DO NOT REDESIGN. STAY WITHIN SCOPE. DO NOT OVERENGINEER**

MAKE ONLY THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE CHANGE THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THE NARROW AND SPECIFIC PROBLEM AT HAND.
