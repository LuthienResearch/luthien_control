# Development Log - Wed Apr  9 11:36:34 EDT 2025 (Continued from dev/log_archive/development_log_20250409_113634.md.gz)

## [2025-04-09 11:36] - Update Project Plan with Policy Framework

### Changes Made
- Updated `dev/ProjectPlan.md` to replace the "Modular Pipeline Refactor" section with items based on the "Control Policy Application Framework" described in `dev/policy_application_framework.md`.
- Marked "Define `TransactionContext` object to carry state" and "Define `ControlPolicy` interface for composable processing steps" as complete (`[X]`) in `dev/ProjectPlan.md`.

### Current Status
- `dev/ProjectPlan.md` reflects the new policy framework plan.
- Core interfaces (`TransactionContext`, `ControlPolicy`) are defined.
- Ready to proceed with implementing the remaining components of the policy framework.

## [2024-08-15 11:40] - Implement ResponseBuilder Interface (TDD)

### Changes Made
- Added `ResponseBuilder` protocol to `luthien_control/control_policy/interface.py`.
- Created skeleton `SimpleResponseBuilder` in `luthien_control/control_policy/response_builder.py`.
- Created unit tests in `tests/control_policy/test_response_builder.py` covering cases with and without `context.response`.
- Ran tests, confirmed failure (as expected due to missing implementation).
  ```
  poetry run pytest tests/control_policy/test_response_builder.py | cat
  ... (output showed 2 failures) ...
  ```
- Implemented `SimpleResponseBuilder.build_response` to create `fastapi.Response` from `context.response` or raise `ValueError` if `context.response` is None.
- Ran tests again, confirmed success.
  ```
  poetry run pytest tests/control_policy/test_response_builder.py | cat
  ... (output showed 2 passes) ...
  ```
- Updated `dev/ProjectPlan.md` to mark `ResponseBuilder` definition as complete.

### Current Status
- `ResponseBuilder` interface defined.
- `SimpleResponseBuilder` implemented and tested.
- Ready to proceed with implementing the orchestrating endpoint.

## [2025-04-09 12:17] - Refactor Test Helpers Location

### Changes Made
- Moved mock files `exceptions.py` and `policies.py` from `luthien_control/testing/mocks/` to `tests/mocks/`. (`mv luthien_control/testing/mocks/*.py tests/mocks/`)
- Updated import paths in `tests/proxy/test_server.py` from `luthien_control.testing.mocks.policies` to `tests.mocks.policies`.
- Removed the old `luthien_control/testing/` directory (`rm -rf luthien_control/testing`).
- Corrected `tests/proxy/test_server.py` to revert accidental changes back to using `respx` and `TestClient` instead of `pytest-asyncio` and `AsyncClient`/`HTTPXMock`.
- Verified changes by running `poetry run pytest`.

### Current Status
- Tests pass successfully.
- Test helper code is now correctly located within the `tests/` directory structure.

## [2025-04-09 13:51] - Implement Policy Orchestration Logic (TDD)

### Changes Made
- Created orchestration module: `luthien_control/proxy/orchestration.py`
- Defined skeleton `async def run_policy_flow(...)` function.
- Created test module: `tests/proxy/test_orchestration.py`
- Implemented comprehensive unit tests for `run_policy_flow` using `pytest` and `unittest.mock`:
    - `test_run_policy_flow_successful`: Covers normal execution flow.
    - `test_run_policy_flow_policy_exception`: Covers exceptions during main policy execution.
    - `test_run_policy_flow_initial_policy_exception`: Covers exceptions during initial context policy execution.
- Ran tests against skeleton (confirmed `NotImplementedError` failures):
  ```
  poetry run pytest tests/proxy/test_orchestration.py | cat
  ... (3 failures) ...
  ```
- Implemented the `run_policy_flow` logic:
    - Generates `transaction_id`.
    - Creates `TransactionContext`.
    - Executes `initial_context_policy`.
    - Iterates through `policies`, executing each in a `try/except` block.
    - Calls `builder.build_response` with the final context.
    - Added basic logging for policy exceptions.
- Ran tests against implementation (debugged mock interactions and assertions):
  ```
  poetry run pytest tests/proxy/test_orchestration.py | cat
  ... (3 failures - uuid mock call count) ...
  poetry run pytest tests/proxy/test_orchestration.py | cat
  ... (3 failures - await return_value, hasattr check) ...
  poetry run pytest tests/proxy/test_orchestration.py | cat
  ... (3 passed) ...
  ```
- Ran full test suite to check for regressions:
  ```
  poetry run pytest | cat
  ... (72 passed, 1 deselected) ...
  ```

### Current Status
- `run_policy_flow` orchestration logic is implemented and unit-tested.
- Core functionality handles policy sequencing and exceptions.
- Full test suite passes.
- Ready to refactor `proxy_endpoint` to use this new orchestrator.

## [2025-04-09 13:59] - Strategy Change: Implement Parallel V2 Endpoint

### Changes Made
- Adjusted development plan based on user feedback.
- Instead of refactoring the existing `/ {full_path:path}` (`proxy_endpoint`), the next step will be to implement a new, parallel endpoint (e.g., `/v2/{full_path:path}`) that utilizes the `run_policy_flow` orchestrator.
- The existing endpoint will remain untouched for now.
- Updated `dev/current_context.md` to reflect this new plan.

### Current Status
- Plan updated.
- Ready to implement the new `/v2` endpoint.

## [2025-04-09 14:11] - Implement and Test Parallel /beta Endpoint (with Debugging)

### Changes Made
- Implemented `proxy_endpoint_beta` in `luthien_control/proxy/server.py`:
    - Decorated with `@router.api_route("/beta/{full_path:path}", ...)`
    - Added call to `run_policy_flow`, passing dependency-injected `request`, `client`, `settings`, `initial_context_policy`, `policies`, and `builder`.
- Added unit tests for `proxy_endpoint_beta` in `tests/proxy/test_server.py`:
    - Used `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `run_policy_flow`.
    - `test_proxy_endpoint_beta_calls_orchestrator`: Verified correct call to `run_policy_flow` and response passthrough (GET request).
    - `test_proxy_endpoint_beta_handles_post`: Verified functionality with POST requests.
- **Debugging Cycle:** Ran tests iteratively to fix several issues:
    - Added missing `from fastapi import Response` import in `tests/proxy/test_server.py` (`NameError`).
    - Reordered endpoint definitions in `luthien_control/proxy/server.py` to place `/beta/...` before `/...` (fixed 502 Bad Gateway due to incorrect routing).
    - Modified `get_control_policies` in `luthien_control/proxy/server.py` to inject `settings` into `PrepareBackendHeadersPolicy` (`TypeError`).
    - Modified `get_control_policies` to inject `http_client` into `SendBackendRequestPolicy` (`TypeError`).
    - Corrected `content-type` assertion in `tests/proxy/test_server.py` to use `startswith('text/plain')` (`AssertionError`).
    - Added missing `from fastapi import Request` import in `tests/proxy/test_server.py` (`NameError`).
    - Added `@runtime_checkable` to `ControlPolicy` in `luthien_control/control_policy/interface.py` (`TypeError` on `isinstance`).
    - Added `@runtime_checkable` to `ResponseBuilder` in `luthien_control/core/response_builder/interface.py` (`TypeError` on `isinstance`).
- Final Test Run:
  ```
  poetry run pytest | cat
  ... (74 passed, 1 deselected) ...
  ```

### Current Status
- `/beta/{full_path:path}` endpoint implemented using `run_policy_flow`.
- Endpoint is unit-tested, mocking the orchestrator.
- All unit and integration tests are passing.

## [2025-04-09 16:08] - Implement Control Policy Framework and Beta Endpoint

### Changes Made
- Created `ControlPolicy` interface (`control_policy/interface.py`).
- Created `TransactionContext` (`core/context.py`).
- Created `ResponseBuilder` interface and default implementation (`core/response_builder/`).
- Implemented `InitializeContextPolicy` to extract request data and path (`control_policy/initialize_context.py`).
- Implemented `PrepareBackendHeadersPolicy` to set Host, X-Request-ID, etc. (`control_policy/prepare_backend_headers.py`).
- Implemented `SendBackendRequestPolicy` to build backend URL and send request (`control_policy/send_backend_request.py`).
- Added orchestrator function `run_policy_flow` (`proxy/orchestration.py`).
- Added dynamic loading for control policies via `CONTROL_POLICIES` env var in `policy_loader.py` and `dependencies.py`.
- Added `/beta/{full_path:path}` endpoint in `proxy/server.py` using the new framework.
- Refactored `config/settings.py` to use getter methods and handle `CONTROL_POLICIES`.
- Added unit tests for all new components.
- Added basic E2E test (`test_beta_proxy_with_simple_flow`) for the `/beta` endpoint in `tests/proxy/test_server.py`.
- Updated test logging configuration in `tests/conftest.py`.
- Cleaned up logging levels (INFO -> DEBUG) and removed temporary comments.
- Ensured `settings.py` raises errors for invalid critical config.

### Current Status
- Core control policy framework is implemented.
- Policies can be loaded dynamically via environment variables.
- The `/beta` endpoint successfully proxies requests using the configured policies.
- Unit tests and a basic E2E test are passing.
- Staged changes have been reviewed and cleaned up.
- Next step is to add more comprehensive E2E tests for the `/beta` endpoint.

## [2024-05-16 04:18] - Implement E2E Test for Beta Endpoint

### Changes Made
- Added `test_e2e_beta_chat_completion` to `tests/e2e/test_proxy_e2e.py` to target the `/beta/chat/completions` endpoint.
- Modified `live_local_proxy_server` fixture in `tests/e2e/conftest.py` to set the `CONTROL_POLICIES` environment variable with necessary policies (`SendBackendRequestPolicy`). Temporarily commented out `RequestLoggingPolicy` as it's not implemented.
- Modified `SendBackendRequestPolicy` in `luthien_control/control_policy/send_backend_request.py` to correctly prepare backend headers (Host, Accept-Encoding) and access request content (`.content` instead of `.body()`).
- Ran `poetry run pytest -m e2e -v` multiple times to debug and confirm fixes.

### Current Status
- Both `test_e2e_chat_completion` and `test_e2e_beta_chat_completion` tests pass.
- Beta endpoint `/beta/{full_path:path}` is verified to route correctly and communicate with the backend using the new policy framework (with `SendBackendRequestPolicy`).
