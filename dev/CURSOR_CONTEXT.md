# Current Working Context

## Implementation Phase
- Project Phase: Testing and Refinement (focused on improving test coverage)
- Specific Component: Unit Testing for `luthien_control/proxy/server.py`

## Working State
- What is currently working:
  - Proxy server core functionality (request/response handling, header processing).
  - `luthien_control/proxy/server.py` has 100% unit test coverage.
  - Integration tests for proxy server (`tests/integration/test_proxy_server.py`) are passing (locally).
  - Basic logging infrastructure (file, API, DB) is functional.
  - Basic policy management framework is in place.
- What is not working/incomplete:
  - Unit test coverage for many modules is low or non-existent.
  - Overall project test coverage is around 62%.
- Recent changes made:
  - Added comprehensive unit tests for `luthien_control/proxy/server.py`.
  - Fixed a bug in `content-encoding` handling within the proxy server.
  - Updated `dev/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`.

## Current Blockers
- None currently.

## Next Steps
1. Assess and prioritize improving unit test coverage for other modules (e.g., logging, policy management, base policy).
2. Add unit tests for `luthien_control/policies/base.py` to improve its 82% coverage.
3. Continue adding tests to increase overall project coverage.
