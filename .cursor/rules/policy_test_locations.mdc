# Rule: Policy Test Locations

## Purpose
To document the location of different types of policy-related tests within the `tests/` directory.

## Locations

*   **Policy CRUD Tests:** Database interaction tests for policy creation, reading, updating, and deletion are located in `tests/db/`.
    *   Example: `tests/db/test_policy_crud.py`
*   **Policy Logic/Control Tests:** Tests focusing on the logic and behavior of policy classes themselves (e.g., evaluation, context handling) are located in `tests/control_policy/`.
    *   Examples: `tests/control_policy/test_compound_policy.py`, `tests/control_policy/test_serialization.py`

*Note: This is based on the current structure. If new categories of policy tests emerge, update this rule.*
