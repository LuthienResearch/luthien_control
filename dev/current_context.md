# Current Working Context
[Replace entire file with current state - this is NOT a log]

## Implementation Phase
- Initial core proxy implementation (as per ProjectPlan.md - assuming it exists)
- Focused on basic request forwarding.

## Working State
- FastAPI app structure with proxy mounted (`main.py`, `proxy/server.py`).
- Configuration loading for `BACKEND_URL` via `.env` file (`config/settings.py`).
- Core proxy endpoint forwards GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD requests to `BACKEND_URL`.
- Handles request path, query parameters, headers, and body.
- Streams responses from backend to client.
- Graceful shutdown of `httpx` client implemented.
- Basic backend connection error handling (returns 502).

## Current Blockers
- None directly related to the implemented forwarding logic.
- Requires user to create `.env` and specify `BACKEND_URL` for testing.

## Next Steps
1. Integrate the policy engine for request/response inspection and modification.
2. Implement structured logging for requests and responses.
3. Write unit tests for the configuration loading (`config/settings.py`).
4. Write unit and integration tests for the proxy forwarding logic (`proxy/server.py`).
5. Define and implement specific security policies.
