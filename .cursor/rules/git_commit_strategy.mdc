# Git Commit Strategy

1.  **Goal:** Maintain a clean Git history by committing logical units of work frequently. The commit should ideally contain the code changes *and* the updated tracking files documenting those changes.
2.  **Trigger:** After completing a distinct sub-task, resolving a specific issue, or successfully implementing a requested feature/change, you (the AI assistant) should initiate the commit process.
3.  **Identify Changes:** Identify the modified code/documentation files relevant to the completed work.
4.  **Perform Pre-Commit Tracking:**
    *   As specified in `development_workflow.mdc` (Step 9), after the code changes are complete and tested, **you MUST follow the procedures defined in `dev_tracking.mdc`** to update `dev/development_log.md` and `dev/current_context.md`.
    *   This tracking update reflects the state being committed and **must** be completed *before* proceeding to stage files (Step 5).
5.  **Staging:** State which files you are staging (code/docs identified in step 3 + tracking files updated in step 4) and propose the `git add <files...>` command. If unsure about the files, ask the user *before* proposing the `git add` command.
6.  **Commit Message:** Propose a concise, descriptive commit message **title** following conventional commit standards (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `refactor: ...`, `docs: ...`, `chore: ...`).
    *   **Keep the title short and focused** on the primary change.
    *   **Avoid lengthy commit message bodies.** Detailed descriptions belong in the `dev/development_log.md` file or code comments. Use a body only if essential context cannot be captured otherwise.
7.  **Commit Command:** Propose the `git commit -m "Proposed title"` command for the user to approve/modify/reject. The user's approval of this command serves as the final confirmation.
8.  **Frequency:** Aim for commits after logical steps. Avoid letting too many unrelated changes accumulate before committing. Balance frequency with meaningfulness.
9.  **User Control:** The user always has the final say by approving/rejecting the proposed `git add` and `git commit` commands and can modify the commit message in the terminal interaction.
