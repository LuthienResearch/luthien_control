# Current Working Context

## Implementation Phase
- Initial Project Setup (Complete)
- Next: Foundational Proxy & Logging (Phase 2 from ProjectPlan.md)
- Specific component: Basic FastAPI app setup done, next is the core proxy endpoint.

## Working State
- Basic project structure, dependencies, documentation, and rules are established.
- A minimal FastAPI application is running with a `/health` check endpoint.
- `poetry run uvicorn luthien_control.main:app --reload` starts the server.
- `poetry run pytest` runs (but finds no tests yet).
- `poetry run ruff check .` and `poetry run bandit -r luthien_control/` run without errors.

## Current Blockers
- None. Ready for next implementation step.

## Next Steps
1.  Commit the initial project setup and configuration.
2.  Implement the core proxy endpoint in `luthien_control/main.py` to accept OpenAI-compatible requests.
3.  Define and implement a basic client authentication mechanism (e.g., static API key header).
