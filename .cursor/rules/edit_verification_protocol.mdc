summary: Protocol for verifying code edits using git diff before debugging logic errors.

objective: Prevent bad edits, ensure verification via diff.

generation:
  edit_directive: MUST use ONLY exact changes + `// ... existing code ...`.
  constraint: NEVER add unrequested code. Implement requested change altering fewest lines/structures necessary.

trigger:
  rule: MANDATORY IF AND ONLY IF ANY Condition Met
  conditions:
    - SyntaxError in target file.
    - Pytest fixture/parameter error involving symbols modified/added by the edit.
    - ImportError or NameError possibly caused by the edit (e.g., changes to imports, renames, definition moves).
    - User explicitly questions the applied edit.
    - Error traceback shows no execution path through the modified code sections.
  note: If failure mode aligns with the *intended* logic change of the edit AND no triggers above are met, direct logic debugging may precede diff verification.

  apply these steps if and only if one of the following has occurred:
    1. An edit has apparently failed. Sometimes an edit appears to fail when it has actually succeeded - so check.
    2. We have reason to believe that an error or unexpected behavior may be the result of a file not having the content we expect it to have.

verification:
  tool: git diff HEAD <target_file> | cat
  trigger_condition: MANDATORY AND IF ANY Condition Met
  conditions:

conflict_resolution:
  ground_truth: `git diff` IS GROUND TRUTH over intent/preview.
  actions:
    - Discard conflicting state/preview if diff differs.
    - If diff differs: Acknowledge, explain diff vs intent, fix edit FIRST.

debug_flow:
  - step: Post-edit failure - Check verification triggers.
  - step: IF trigger met - VERIFY EDIT FIRST (`git diff`). If diff incorrect -> fix edit. If diff correct -> debug logic.
  - step: IF NO trigger met - Debug logic (assess if failure aligns with edit intent; remain vigilant for latent edit errors).
