# Development Log - Wed Apr  9 11:36:34 EDT 2025 (Continued from dev/log_archive/development_log_20250409_113634.md.gz)

## [2025-04-09 11:36] - Update Project Plan with Policy Framework

### Changes Made
- Updated `dev/ProjectPlan.md` to replace the "Modular Pipeline Refactor" section with items based on the "Control Policy Application Framework" described in `dev/policy_application_framework.md`.
- Marked "Define `TransactionContext` object to carry state" and "Define `ControlPolicy` interface for composable processing steps" as complete (`[X]`) in `dev/ProjectPlan.md`.

### Current Status
- `dev/ProjectPlan.md` reflects the new policy framework plan.
- Core interfaces (`TransactionContext`, `ControlPolicy`) are defined.
- Ready to proceed with implementing the remaining components of the policy framework.

## [2024-08-15 11:40] - Implement ResponseBuilder Interface (TDD)

### Changes Made
- Added `ResponseBuilder` protocol to `luthien_control/control_policy/interface.py`.
- Created skeleton `SimpleResponseBuilder` in `luthien_control/control_policy/response_builder.py`.
- Created unit tests in `tests/control_policy/test_response_builder.py` covering cases with and without `context.response`.
- Ran tests, confirmed failure (as expected due to missing implementation).
  ```
  poetry run pytest tests/control_policy/test_response_builder.py | cat
  ... (output showed 2 failures) ...
  ```
- Implemented `SimpleResponseBuilder.build_response` to create `fastapi.Response` from `context.response` or raise `ValueError` if `context.response` is None.
- Ran tests again, confirmed success.
  ```
  poetry run pytest tests/control_policy/test_response_builder.py | cat
  ... (output showed 2 passes) ...
  ```
- Updated `dev/ProjectPlan.md` to mark `ResponseBuilder` definition as complete.

### Current Status
- `ResponseBuilder` interface defined.
- `SimpleResponseBuilder` implemented and tested.
- Ready to proceed with implementing the orchestrating endpoint.

## [2025-04-09 12:17] - Refactor Test Helpers Location

### Changes Made
- Moved mock files `exceptions.py` and `policies.py` from `luthien_control/testing/mocks/` to `tests/mocks/`. (`mv luthien_control/testing/mocks/*.py tests/mocks/`)
- Updated import paths in `tests/proxy/test_server.py` from `luthien_control.testing.mocks.policies` to `tests.mocks.policies`.
- Removed the old `luthien_control/testing/` directory (`rm -rf luthien_control/testing`).
- Corrected `tests/proxy/test_server.py` to revert accidental changes back to using `respx` and `TestClient` instead of `pytest-asyncio` and `AsyncClient`/`HTTPXMock`.
- Verified changes by running `poetry run pytest`.

### Current Status
- Tests pass successfully.
- Test helper code is now correctly located within the `tests/` directory structure.
