When making changes to the codebase:
<change_guidelines>
1. Never remove existing functionality without explicit user request
2. When refactoring or simplifying code:
   - Document what functionality exists before making changes
   - Make changes incrementally, testing after each change
   - If removing code, explain why it's safe to remove
   - If unsure about functionality, ask the user
3. When cleaning up code:
   - Focus on removing unused code only
   - Keep core functionality intact
   - Don't "simplify" working code unless specifically requested
4. When making changes across multiple files:
   - Document the scope of changes
   - Test each file's functionality after changes
   - Ensure changes don't break existing features
