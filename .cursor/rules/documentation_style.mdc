# Documentation Style

Write plainly and honestly. We're not selling anything.

## Guidelines
- Use simple, direct language
- State what was done, not how great it is  
- Start with action verbs: "Added", "Fixed", "Updated", "Removed"
- Be specific and factual

## Examples
- "Added user authentication"
- "Fixed memory leak in parser" 
- "Updated API to return JSON"
- "Removed deprecated endpoints"
