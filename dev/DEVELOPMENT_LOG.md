# Development Log (Continued from dev/DEVELOPMENT_LOG_20250329_175844.md)

## [2024-03-29 17:58] - Created Git Commit Strategy Rule

### Changes Made
- Created new rule file `.cursor/rules/git_commit_strategy.mdc`.
- Content defines a strategy for:
    - Triggering commits after logical work units.
    - Updating tracking files (`dev/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, `dev/CURSOR_CONTEXT.md`) *before* staging and committing.
    - Staging code changes and tracking files together.
    - Proposing a conventional commit message and the `git commit` command for user approval via the terminal.
    - Relying on terminal command approval instead of explicit chat confirmation.

### Current Status
- New rule `git_commit_strategy.mdc` created and saved.
- Development Log rotation occurred due to exceeding line limit.

### Next Steps
- Update `dev/CURSOR_CONTEXT.md`.
- Commit the new rule file and the updated tracking files.
