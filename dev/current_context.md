# Current Task: Completed DB-Driven Policy Integration

**Goal:** Integrate the new database-driven policy loading mechanism based on `load_policy_instance` into the core request flow.

**Status:** Task completed. Changes made to `dependencies.py`, `orchestration.py`, and `server.py` to use the new loading mechanism. Added/updated tests in `test_dependencies.py`, `test_orchestration.py`, `test_server.py`, and `conftest.py`. All tests passed.

**Next Steps:**
- Commit the changes following `git_commit_strategy`.
- Potentially define a new task, e.g., creating initial policy configurations in the database or setting up migrations.
