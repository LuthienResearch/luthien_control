# AI Control Framework

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an AI Control framework that implements a proxy server for AI model APIs (like OpenAI). The proxy creates a secure middleware layer that can monitor, filter, and modify communications between client applications and AI services to ensure safe, controlled AI usage.

## Strategy
1. **Intercept & Analyze**: Monitor all traffic between client applications and AI services through our proxy server
2. **Apply Control Policies**: Implement configurable rule-based evaluations on every request and response 
3. **Enforce Safety**: Filter, modify, or block potentially harmful interactions based on established safety protocols
4. **Demonstrate Control**: Show practical applications with code assistants to prevent data exfiltration, backdoor code generation, and other risks

## Implementation Approach
- Build a transparent proxy server that preserves API compatibility
- Create a flexible policy engine for custom safety rules
- Develop comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities
- Focus on demonstrating Redwood's AI Control techniques in production-ready scenarios

This framework will provide organizations with practical AI safety tools to leverage model capabilities while mitigating risks associated with frontier AI deployment.
