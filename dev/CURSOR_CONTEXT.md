# Current Working Context

## Implementation Phase
- Control Policy Framework Implementation
- Core abstractions and integration complete

## Working State
- Implemented a class-based control policy system with a `ControlPolicy` abstract base class
- Created a `PolicyManager` for registering and applying policies to requests/responses
- Modified proxy/server.py to apply policies during request/response handling
- Created a `NoopPolicy` as the default policy that maintains original behavior
- Created initialize.py to manage server and policy initialization
- Added example policy (TokenCounterPolicy) but left it commented out
- Updated imports in __init__.py

## Current Blockers
- None

## Next Steps
1. Implement specific control policies based on requirements
2. Write unit tests for the policy framework
3. Add ability to enable/disable policies via configuration
4. Consider adding a policy registry for discovery and documentation
