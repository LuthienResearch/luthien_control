# Current Working Context

## Implementation Phase
- Testing Infrastructure Improvements
- Integration Test Environment Configuration

## Working State
- Integration tests fully functional with environment selection
- Local and deployed testing environments configured
- Test documentation updated with usage instructions
- All tests passing (6 local, 5 deployed + 1 skipped)

## Current Blockers
- None - Environment configuration complete and working

## Next Steps
1. Add more integration test coverage for:
   - Additional endpoints
   - Error conditions
   - Performance/load scenarios
2. Review and improve test coverage in other areas:
   - api_logger.py (27% coverage)
   - db_logger.py (38% coverage)
   - proxy/server.py (47% coverage)
3. Consider adding integration tests for logging functionality
