## [2024-03-19 Current Time] - Planning Request/Response Exploration System

### Changes Made
- Developed initial data model for tracking proxy communications
- Established terminology: using "Comm" as base unit
- Designed preliminary schema for Comm and CommRelationship tables

### Current Status
- Working: N/A (Planning Phase)
- Design Decisions Made:
  - Using PostgreSQL for storage
  - Two-table design (Comm + CommRelationship)
  - Flexible relationship modeling with string types
  - JSON fields for content and metadata
  - No constraints on relationships initially

### Next Steps
- Research standard HTTP/networking terms for source/destination
- Design basic indexes
- Plan query patterns
- Design API for logging/querying
- Plan minimal UI requirements

## [2024-03-25 12:30] - Implemented Communications Logging System

### Changes Made
- Added SQLAlchemy and asyncpg dependencies via poetry
- Created database models for communications and relationships
- Implemented simplified DBLogger for tracking communications

### Current Status
- Basic communication logging is implemented with:
  - Source/destination tracking
  - Request/response type tracking
  - Content storage as JSONB
  - Flexible relationship tracking between communications
  - Simple query interface for related communications

### Implementation Details
```python
# Core data model:
Comm:
  - id: UUID
  - source: Text
  - destination: Text
  - type: Enum("REQUEST", "RESPONSE")
  - content: JSONB
  - endpoint: Text
  - arguments: JSONB
  - trigger: JSONB  # For control-server originated comms

CommRelationship:
  - id: UUID
  - from_comm_id: UUID
  - to_comm_id: UUID
  - relationship_type: Text
  - metadata: JSONB
```

### Usage Example
```python
logger = DBLogger(session)

# Log a request
request_comm = logger.log_comm(
    source="client",
    destination="proxy",
    comm_type="REQUEST",
    content={"body": request.json()},
    endpoint=request.url,
    arguments=request.query_params
)

# Log and link a related communication
response_comm = logger.log_comm(
    source="proxy",
    destination="client",
    comm_type="RESPONSE",
    content={"body": response.json()}
)

# Create relationship
logger.add_relationship(
    request_comm,
    response_comm,
    "request_response"
)
```

### Next Steps
1. Create database migration scripts
2. Add basic test suite
3. Implement proxy integration
4. Consider adding:
   - Query methods for common use cases
   - Async support if needed
   - UI/API for exploring logged communications

## [2024-03-25 12:38] - Implemented Test Suite for Communications Logging

### Changes Made
- Added pytest and related dependencies (pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov)
- Created comprehensive test suite for models and database logger
- Fixed SQLAlchemy naming conflict (renamed metadata to meta_info)
- Added test configuration in pyproject.toml

### Current Status
- Test coverage for core components:
  - Database models (Comm, CommRelationship)
  - Database logger (DBLogger)
  - Relationship tracking and navigation
- Tests verify:
  - Basic CRUD operations
  - Relationship creation and querying
  - Complex relationship chains
  - Data integrity

### Next Steps
1. Add integration tests with proxy server
2. Add performance tests for database operations
3. Fix api_logger tests
4. Add more edge case tests

## [2024-03-27 15:30] - Integration Test Environment Configuration

### Changes Made
- Added `--env` command line option to control test environment selection
- Removed redundant `RUN_DEPLOYED_TESTS` environment variable
- Updated test configuration to support local, deployed, or both environments
- Added comprehensive documentation for test environment usage
- Modified `test_invalid_api_key` to skip automatically for deployed instance

### Current Status
- Working:
  - Local server tests (all passing)
  - Deployed server tests (5 passing, 1 skipped)
  - Environment selection via `--env` option
  - Test documentation and usage instructions
- Not Working:
  - N/A - All functionality working as intended

### Next Steps
- Consider adding more integration tests for other endpoints
- Consider adding performance/load testing scenarios
- Consider adding test coverage for error conditions

## [2024-03-27 11:37] - Added Unit Tests for Proxy Server and Fixed Bug

### Changes Made
- Created `tests/proxy/test_server.py` with comprehensive unit tests for `luthien_control/proxy/server.py`.
- Added tests covering:
  - `get_headers` function (header cleaning, API key injection, auth preservation).
  - `health_check` endpoint.
  - `proxy_request` function (success path, policy mocks, error handling).
- Identified and fixed a bug in `luthien_control/proxy/server.py` related to handling the `content-encoding` header when 'br' was present. Updated logic to correctly parse and remove 'br' encoding.
- Added a specific test case (`test_proxy_request_only_br_content_encoding`) to ensure 100% coverage of the fixed logic.
- Ran `poetry run pytest tests/proxy/test_server.py -v --cov=luthien_control.proxy.server --cov-report=term-missing`. All 8 tests passed, achieving 100% coverage for `luthien_control/proxy/server.py`.

### Current Status
- Working:
  - Unit tests for `luthien_control/proxy/server.py` are passing.
  - `luthien_control/proxy/server.py` has 100% unit test coverage.
  - The `content-encoding` bug is fixed.
- Not Working/Incomplete:
  - Overall project test coverage needs further improvement (currently 62% according to the last full run).
  - Several other modules still have low or no coverage (e.g., `__main__.py`, `api_logger.py`, `db_logger.py`, `file_logging.py`, `manager.py`, `run.py`).

### Next Steps
- Evaluate coverage for other modules and prioritize adding unit tests for core functionality (e.g., logging, policy management).
- Address the 82% coverage in `luthien_control/policies/base.py`.

## [2024-03-29 13:00] - Achieved 100% Test Coverage for `server.py` and Performed Upkeep

### Changes Made
- Increased unit test coverage for `luthien_control/proxy/server.py` to 100%.
- Debugged and resolved issues with hanging tests and mock setup in `tests/proxy/test_server.py`.
- Ran `poetry run pytest --cov=luthien_control --cov-report term-missing` to confirm coverage.
- Deleted unused files: `test_decode.py`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- Reviewed contents of `scratch/` directory (determined files are potentially still needed).

### Current Status
- `luthien_control/proxy/server.py` now has full unit test coverage.
- Core proxy functionality is well-tested at the unit level.
- Project structure cleaned slightly by removing unused top-level files.

### Next Steps
1. Configure and run static analysis tools (e.g., linters, security scanners).
2. Update `dev/CURSOR_CONTEXT.md` to reflect current state and plan.
3. Begin implementation and testing of the Policy Engine (`policies/`).

## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Complete Proxy Refactor & Fix Tests

### Changes Made
- Refactored `luthien_control/proxy/server.py` (split `proxy_request`, loaded config from env `TARGET_URL` & `OPENAI_API_KEY`, added docs).
- Ran `poetry run pytest`, encountered failures related to refactoring and a state mutation bug.
- Modified `tests/logging/test_file_logging.py`: Updated mock `open` assertion to include `encoding`.
- Modified `tests/proxy/test_server.py`:
    - Fixed import error for `_prepare_request_headers`.
    - Updated tests using `_prepare_request_headers` to use explicit `Headers` objects.
    - Corrected expected status code in `test_proxy_request_request_error` from 500 to 502.
    - Corrected assertion key case in `test_get_headers_removes_unwanted` (`Authorization`).
- Modified `luthien_control/policies/manager.py`:
    - Refactored `apply_request_policies` to correctly handle state between policy calls, avoiding in-loop mutation by creating `next_data` based on `current_data` and `policy_result`.
- Modified `tests/policies/test_manager.py`:
    - Updated `test_apply_request_policies_single` and `test_apply_request_policies_multiple` to use individual argument assertions (`assert_called_once()`, `mock.call_args`) to correctly verify the state passed to each policy mock.
- Ran `poetry run pytest` again - All 61 tests passed.

### Current Status
- `luthien_control/proxy/` module reviewed and refactored.
- All unit tests are passing.
- Core proxy logic is cleaner and more configurable.
- Identified and fixed a state mutation bug in `PolicyManager.apply_request_policies`.

### Next Steps
- Review the `luthien_control/policies/` directory for code smells and potential improvements.
- Update `dev/CURSOR_CONTEXT.md`.

## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Add Concurrency Test for TokenCounterPolicy

### Changes Made
- Created `luthien_control/policies/examples/tests/test_token_counter.py`.
- Added `test_concurrent_counting_accuracy` using `asyncio` and `unittest.mock`.
- The test verifies token counting accuracy under simulated concurrent load by mocking `tiktoken`.

### Current Status
- `TokenCounterPolicy` exists.
- A basic concurrency test (`test_concurrent_counting_accuracy`) has been added.
- Test needs to be run to confirm functionality.

### Next Steps
- Run the new test using `poetry run pytest luthien_control/policies/examples/tests/test_token_counter.py::test_concurrent_counting_accuracy`.
- Add more tests for `TokenCounterPolicy` edge cases (e.g., non-JSON bodies, different content types, errors during processing).

## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Relocate Tests and Update Rules

### Changes Made
- Moved `luthien_control/policies/examples/tests/test_token_counter.py` to `tests/policies/examples/test_token_counter.py`.
- Updated `.cursor/rules/project_organization.mdc` to specify that tests should reside in a top-level `tests/` directory mirroring the main package structure.

### Current Status
- Test file relocated to `tests/` directory structure.
- Project organization rule updated.
- Previous test run failed due to import errors, expected to be resolved by the move.

### Next Steps
- Re-run the test from its new location: `poetry run pytest tests/policies/examples/test_token_counter.py::test_concurrent_counting_accuracy`.

## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Add Error Handling Tests for TokenCounterPolicy

### Changes Made
- Added `test_process_request_invalid_json` to `tests/policies/examples/test_token_counter.py` to cover the request JSON error handling path.
- Added `test_process_response_invalid_json` to `tests/policies/examples/test_token_counter.py` to cover the response JSON error handling path.
- Used `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `logging.error` and verify it's called during exceptions.

### Current Status
- New tests for error handling paths added.
- Overall coverage expected to increase for `token_counter.py`.

### Next Steps
- Run the full test suite again to confirm the new tests pass and check updated coverage: `poetry run pytest | cat`.

## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - Add Test for 'name' Key in TokenCounterPolicy

### Changes Made
- Identified that line 42 (`num_tokens -= 1`) in `_count_tokens_in_messages` was the remaining missed line.
- Added `test_process_request_with_name_key` to `tests/policies/examples/test_token_counter.py`.
- This test uses mock data containing a message with a `name` key to ensure the specific code path for handling it is executed and tested.

### Current Status
- New test added to cover the `name` key scenario.
- Coverage for `token_counter.py` expected to reach 100%.

### Next Steps
- Run the full test suite again: `poetry run pytest | cat`.

## [2024-03-29 11:00] - Revised Pre-Commit Workflow

### Changes Made
- Modified `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
    - Removed `ruff-format` hook.
    - Removed `trailing-whitespace` hook.
    - Kept `ruff check --fix`, `bandit`, and `mypy` for linting, security, and type checking.
- Modified `README.md`:
    - Updated the "Development Tools" section to explain the new workflow.
    - Clarified that developers are now responsible for code formatting (`poetry run ruff format .`) *before* staging files (`git add`).
    - Explained that `ruff check --fix` will still run and may require re-staging if it makes minor fixes.

### Current Status
- Pre-commit configuration updated to separate code modification (formatting) from code checking.
- Documentation updated to reflect the new developer workflow.
- Goal is to achieve a smoother, faster, and more predictable commit process by eliminating conflicts caused by auto-formatting hooks modifying files during the commit stash/unstash cycle.

### Next Steps
- Monitor the effectiveness of the new workflow.
- Test the commit process with the updated hooks.
- Update `dev/CURSOR_CONTEXT.md`.
