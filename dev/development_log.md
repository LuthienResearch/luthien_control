## 2025-04-23 11:06 - Refactor Policy CRUD and Error Handling

**Goal:** Refactor `luthien_control/db/sqlmodel_crud.py` to align policy CRUD operations with the new loader approach, removing redundant functions and ensuring correct error handling.

**Changes:**
- Removed `create_policy_config` and `update_policy_config` functions from `luthien_control/db/sqlmodel_crud.py`.
- Updated `create_policy` (renamed to `save_policy_to_db` by user during process) and `update_policy` to handle `SQLAlchemyError` and `IntegrityError`.
- Corrected `IntegrityError` handling to re-raise the exception instead of returning `None` based on user feedback.
- Updated `tests/db/test_sqlmodel_crud.py::test_create_policy_duplicate_name` to use `pytest.raises(IntegrityError)` to match the corrected function behavior.
- Verified all tests in `tests/db/test_sqlmodel_crud.py` pass.
- Addressed an apparent `ImportError` reported by the user when running all tests, though the relevant import in `sqlmodel_crud.py` seemed correct upon inspection. User confirmed tests passed overall.

**Status:** Completed. Tests related to the module pass.

**Next Steps:** Update `current_context.md`, then commit changes.
